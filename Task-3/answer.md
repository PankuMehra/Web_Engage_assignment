1. What will be your approach to solving this issue? Explain your strategy and approach to this ?
=> My approach in this circumstances will be to give my importance to Task no.2 for the prior one, because their campaign has to go live in next 2 days, which is a more crucial deadline and as well as I will take care of my family members by providing them their essential needs and I will ask for an extension for Task 1 and communicate the situation clearly to the customer 1 as it is for a low-priority customer so I will try to communicate to extend the deadline by just 1 or 2 days later. By this approach, I can focus my efforts on completing 1 task atleast in the given time and manage both the customer by communicating and and expressing my regret for the inconvenience and explaining the reasons for the delay. I will also provide a revised timeline for completing Task 1 and offer to provide regular updates to keep them informed.

2. How will you inform the 2 separate account managers of both customers about your approach? Write an internal message informing Manoj (Account manager for Task 1) & Ravi (Account Manager for Task 2) about your respective approach.

        Dear Sir,
        I hope you're doing well. I am writing to inform you of a situation that has arisen that may impact the completion of the Task.
    
        Due to a family emergency, I will not be able to meet the original due date for the task. I understand the importance of meeting deadlines and I am committed to ensuring that the task is completed to the best of my abilities. I would like to ask for an extension for the task. I will keep you informed of any updates. I am available to discuss any concerns that you may have and to provide you with a revised timeline as soon as possible.

3. How will you communicate the delay of additional 3 days to the customer? (Write an email to the customer informing them about this).
=> To Customer,
     Subject- Informing regarding project delay
     Dear Sir/Ma'am,
     I hope you are well and good. I regret to inform you that I am unable to complete the given task on time which was expected to be submit today itself.

     Actually today I had a family emergency due to which some aspects of the task are still pending. So, I need 3 more days to accomplish the task and the expected date to submit the task will be at 06-02-2023 and I ensure you these type of inconviences will not happen again in the future tasks.
     
     I appreciate your flexibility and understanding as we tackle this unforeseen issue.

     Thank you. Please contact me if you have any questions about the delay, the new schedule or anything else.
     
    Regards,
    Pankaj Mehra
